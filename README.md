# OptiVi-website

This web page Iâ€™ve designed to showcase final assignments that I have completed as part of CISW 304 Spring2019 semester. 

Here is great overall use of page layout. The content is clearly laid out and the pages are responsive. As the page scrolls down, 
the reader is introduced to ore information about the Eye Care availability to them.

The navigation is clear and pages have a consistent feel with the overall site. The color choice does match what I would expect from
the medical field with desaturated blue tones.

Using the images carousel was a great touch, as well as the buttons on the home page that reveal more information.
